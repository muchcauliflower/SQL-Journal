# SQL-Journal
This Journal is mainly just for my current SQL progress

Majority of the resources I am using is from Data with Baraa's SQL Full Course for Beginners.

I know. People will go against this since it's 'Tutorial Hell' but I won't know where to look for resources.

Anywho lets get right to it.
